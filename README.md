# `zero2prod`

Following along with https://zero2prod.com/.

## Features

Per the user stories:

- > As a blog visitor,<br>
  > I want to subscribe to the newsletter,<br>
  > So that I can receive email updates when new content is published on the blog;

- > As the blog author,<br>
  > I want to send an email to all my confirmed subscribers,<br>
  > So that I can notify them when new content is published;

- > As a subscriber,<br>
  > I want to be able to unsubscribe from the newsletter,<br>
  > So that I can stop receiving email updates from the blog.

Explicitly out of scope:

- Manage multiple newsletters;
- Segment subscribers in multiple audiences;
- Track opening and click rates.

## Divergence from the book

- [axum](https://docs.rs/axum/latest/axum/) is used as the web framework, rather than actix-web.
  axum feels a bit lighter, is a first-party tokio citizen, and benefits from the `hyper` and `tower` ecosystems.
  On the downside it's a bit less mature, so some integrations may be missing.

- No config files â€“ configuration can only be supplied through environment variables.
  I prefer this as it keeps configuration management simple and consistent across all environments, and avoids any of the layering needed with a config file based approach.
  [Envy](https://docs.rs/envy/latest/envy/) is used to drive this.

- Request IDs are set by middleware, rather than per-handler tracing spans.
  This ensures **all** requests are augmented with a request ID.
  The middleware also sets the request ID in a response header, so it could potentially be shown to clients on errors to give a correlation ID for debugging without exposing internal errors or logging PII.

- An alpine-based image is used.
  This gives significantly lighter images (\~10MiB), although there were some hiccups getting it working in DigitalOcean App Platform (see the comment in the [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile)).

## Deployment compatibility

The application is designed to be compatible with a rolling deployment strategy, during which there may be both old and new replicas running concurrently.
The server itself is stateless, however it of course depends on a single database which is used by all running instances, old and new.

Migrations are run when the server is started, which means the database is migrated as soon as a single instance of the new app has been started.
Thus, it's critical that migrations preserve compatibility with the existing application (e.g. no removing in-use fields, no new fields without defaults, no incompatible changes to column types, etc.).
To help ensure this, there's a CI check that runs the test suite from `main` with the migrations from `HEAD`.

Furthermore, if a new deployment is unhealthy after running migrations, further instances may not be rolled out and new instances of the *old* deployment may be started instead.
It's therefore also necessary that instances can start when unknown migrations have been applied (e.g. the database state is ahead of the version known to the instance), so "missing version" errors from sqlx are ignored on startup.

Conversely, it's not necessary for new versions of the app to be compatible with the old schema (database rollbacks are not supported).
